```php
        "SP1" => [
         # Link MUST be the same as the key (top left)
            "link" => 'SP1',
            "name" => 'Ersti-Spieleabend',
         #   Time of event (hour, minute, second, MONTH, DAY, year)
         #   This timestamp is used by prune_events.php, so make sure it is set correctly, otherwise the registrations will be deleted automatically!
            "startUTS" => mktime('18', '0', '0', '04', '20', '2023'),
         #   Date of event (hour, minute, second, MONTH, DAY, year)
         #   Time is ignored, only date is used 
            "endUTS" => mktime('23', '0', '0', '04', '20', '2023'),
         # Has the event a strict time frame?
            "onTime" => FALSE,
         # Is the event active? If not, this event won't be shown.
            "active" => TRUE,
